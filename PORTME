Differences and port info:


This change was done to MUSL
==============================

- We define __LIBSYSTEM__ in our include/features.h header in order to detect "libSystem" as the default libc, instead of having to rely on heuristic tests to detect musl.

Config.sub
==============

- In line 1687 we add "system" as a libc option
- In line 1698 we add "Utopia" as an operating system
- In line 1775 we add both "linux-utopia*" and "linux-system*" to the list of valid kernel libc implementation
- We add "-system" to line 1749 in order to tell that our libc is not a standalone operating system

Config.gcc
=================
If the target is on linux-utopia the default C library becomes libSystem
Define UTOPIA_DEFAULT if on Utopia targets


Fixincludes/mkfixinc.sh
=============================

Since libSystem is based on musl we still need to fix the includes, we do this on line23 of this file

Stack protector
===========================

Again since we are derived from musl, we want to tell GCC that we provide a stack protector by default, this can be done by enabling:  gcc_cv_libc_provides_ssp=yes when our target is linux-system*

Ability of dl_iterate_phdr
============================

Since we are derived on Musl, we need to tell GCC our implementation also provides this ability, so we tell GCC that:     gcc_cv_target_dl_iterate_phdr=yes when compiling for linux-system*

glibc-stdint.h
===========================
We should define OPTION_SYSTEM as "0" and fix the macros here, to also provide our implementation of datatypes

linux.c
=============================
As of know linux_libc_has_function only returns true if glibc or musl, we can return "true" if we are on libsystem too

Linux.h
===========================
Add libSystem to the singlelibc configuration, here we also need to changes on the stage that gcc chooses a dynamic linker, mainly, in lines 75 where it is generated

As per comment: /* musl avoids problematic includes by rearranging the include directories.
 * Unfortunately, this is mostly duplicated from cppdefault.c */ 
 
 We would need to see if we want to fix on libSystem side or fix it on GCC side using the same patch musl got merged upstream
 
 Linux.opt
=================
Add msystem to the options

libstdc++v3/configure.host
=========================
Tell the compiler we are a generic OS if we are on libSystem
